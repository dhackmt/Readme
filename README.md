## Hi I am DRISHTI JADHWANI

<p>As a BCA fresher with a diverse set of skills and interests, I'm passionate about exploring the intersections between technology and creativity. Currently,  With a strong foundation in C language and HTML, and ongoing learning of Python and JavaScript, I'm committed to expanding my knowledge of software development.</p>
<p>In addition, I'm learning the German language, which provides opportunities for cultural exchange and growth. When I'm not coding, I enjoy creating beautiful mandala art, which helps me unwind and express myself creatively. I'm always looking for exciting collaboration opportunities, so please feel free to DM me to discuss potential projects. Follow me on GitHub to see how I bring my unique perspective to programming challenges.</p>
